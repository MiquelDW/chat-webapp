- update creation of message in "server > sockets > messageHandler.ts"
You might not even need the "messageHandler.ts" file, you can do that in Next.js, but you have to figure out
if you can create a room within "StreamServiceMessage.ts" when a user connects to a chatroom

- fix the chat rooms issue, where different rooms still can chat with each other (might be a development bug...)

- Load in all conversations using the newly created "conversations" state and the "getConversations" action function

- Fix Clerk Webhook issue (might need to create new webhook or something)
If it works in production, then you don't have to do anything
