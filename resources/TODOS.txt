- Fix fetching issue when creating a new message. 
Figure out the best solution for marking a message as read (test if messaging works without using the useEffect to mark message as read)

- Figure out if you can store and retrieve new data directly from the state instead of refetching from the db again. Refetching messages, individual convo's,
all convo's, etc from db makes your app really slow.

- Make the Friend Requests Count and Unseen Messages Count real-time as well

- shared conversations state variable from the context provider ONLY gets initialized when you click on the conversations tab, so when you first load the app and don't land
on /conversations page (which it should by default...), you don't fetch all conversations (and unseenMessagesCount)

==== development issues? ====
- Fix the chat rooms issue, where different rooms still can chat with each other (might be a development bug...)

- Fix Clerk Webhook issue (might need to create new webhook or something)
If it works in production, then you don't have to do anything
